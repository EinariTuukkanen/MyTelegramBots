# Intro
This repository contains few small independent Telegram bot scripts. More info about Telegram and bots can be found at https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution.

## NorppaBot
My first bot. Retrieves images from Norppa Live feed (http://wwf.fi/en/norppalive/) and sends them to your chat. Never miss a Norppa again!

### Usage
The command is as simple as `/norppa`.

EDIT: As of summer 2016 the Norppa Live service is down and therefore the bot is redundant until the feed gets up again.

## LyhenneBot
Explains abbreviations. Returns the explanation for words or phrases as well as examples. Uses multiple online dictionaries (currently https://www.urbaanisanakirja.com/ and http://www.urbandictionary.com/).

### Usage
The command for looking up a word is `/lyhenne` or `/lsb` (lyhenne-selittäjä-bot). The parameter after the command is the phrase to explain.
